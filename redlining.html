            <h2>OUR INTERACTIVE MAP</h2>
            <p>The interactive map displayed above shows how historical redlining practices have shaped Austin’s racial
                and economic landscape. The interactive map above shows a “redlining” map drawn by the Home Owners' Loan
                Corporation (HOLC) in July 1934 layered on top of a map of Austin today. Established as part of the New
                Deal, the HOLC was designed to assist homeowners who were defaulted on mortgages. These redlining maps
                were drawn to classify neighborhoods by levels of perceived lending risk based on economic and racial
                composition.</p>
            <p>This Austin map in particular contains 18 residential zones in Austin’s metropolitan area, ranking them
                from A - Best, to D - Hazardous. Note how many of the “D” ranked regions still have low median incomes
                and high minority populations.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background:#000000;">
            <h2>HISTORICAL REDLINING IN AUSTIN</h2>
            <p>This practice of isolating minorities began with the implementation of a “Negro District” in 1928, which
                made East Austin the only place where African Americans could access schools and other public services.
                Many neighborhoods with the restriction that properties could only be sold to whites, most famously Hyde
                Park, were also built around this time.</p>
            <p>These explicitly racist housing restrictions were eventually removed, but were replaced by more subtle
                means. Since African Americans possessed less generational
                wealth and opportunities for employment, they could not afford to move into these richer neighborhoods,
                and as a result continued to be denied access to Austin’s best schools, parks, etc.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div style="background:#000000;">
            <h2>EFFECTS OF REDLINING</h2>
            <p>Redlining continues to be a problem in Austin. This can be seen in how Austin is one of the most racially
                and economically segregated metro areas in the US. Austin continues to be racially divided along I-35:
                African American and Hispanic populations remain concentrated east of the highway, while the population
                west of the highway is predominantly white. This continued exclusion of minorities from good households
                and neighborhoods has led to crime and poverty being concentrated in East Austin, reinforcing the lack
                of private investment in these communities.
            </p>

            <h2>WHAT CAN I DO?</h2>
            <p>Contact your local politicians, and inform them of how redlining continues to undermine racial and
                economic equality in the Austin area. Additionally, you can sign a petition (linked below) to create
                legislation restricting redlining practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless of who you are, you can take steps to ensure more equitable housing in the Austin area.
